Advanced Regression techniques


Choosing to buy or sell a home is a big choice, and figuring out the ideal asking price can be 
difficult. For home owners, real estate brokers, and investors alike, being able to estimate 
house values accurately is crucial in the world of real estate. By using machine learning 
approaches to create predictive models that calculate house values based on numerous 
property qualities and data, the "Predicting House Prices" project aims to address this 
problem.

The goal of this project was to forecast home prices using exploratory data analysis (EDA), 
visualization techniques, data cleaning, preprocessing, and linear models. Additionally, we 
aimed to determine which features add substantial value to a home. The dataset used was 
sourced from Kaggle.
